#circos is configuration file based
#the command to start circos is circos -conf circos.conf
#The conf file calls several types of files including a karyotype file, a color file, ideogram file a data file that contains links
#the datafile with links or homologies between genes or objects is found in the data folder and examples and generation of which is seen below or in the data file.
